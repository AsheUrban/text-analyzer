# _Indepedent Project #2: Programming Language Suggester_

#### Contributors: _**Claire Thorington**_

#### _A survey page demonstrating new skills in JavaScript and jQuery!_


## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Markdown
* JavaScript
* jQuery

## Description

This page asks the user a series of questions to determine which programming language they should learn: Go, Ruby, or Python.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop
* Navigate to the top level of the directory
* Open index.html in your browser

## Known Bugs

* Result at present only takes into account the answer to the first question. An expansion of the scoring system to evaluate all of the questions is underway, but it's either really complicated or I'm making it way harder than it needs to be.
